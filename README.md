### Installation (on Linux)

> [!WARNING]
> Project not stabilized, and still missing many of the features we wanted to implement, we do not recommend attempting to install it at this stage, there is still a lot of jank under the hood to make it work, but it does work.

You'll need the following tools installed beforehand: [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), [`rust toolchain`](https://rustup.rs/), [`seqkit`](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/)
